### Version History Notes

**Version 1.0.0** represents the initial release of the Vector RAG POC, providing a complete foundation for demonstrating how vector databases enhance LLM capabilities through Retrieval-Augmented Generation. The system is production-ready for proof-of-concept and development purposes, with a clear path for scaling to production environments.

Future versions will focus on additional embedding models, advanced search algorithms, user interfaces, and production deployment tools.
